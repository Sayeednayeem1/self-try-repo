            <h1>My Favourite Cartoon Of All Time!</h1>
            <h1>Tom And Jerry.</h1>
            <p>Tom and Jerry is an American cartoon series about a hapless cat's never-ending pursuit of a clever mouse</p>
            <p>Tom is the scheming cat, and Jerry is the spunky mouse. The series was driven entirely by action and visual humour; the characters almost never spoke.</p>
