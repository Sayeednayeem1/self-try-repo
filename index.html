            <h1>Tom And Jerry.</h1>
            <p>Tom and Jerry is an American cartoon series about a hapless cat's never-ending pursuit of a clever mouse.</p>
            <p>Tom is the scheming cat, and Jerry is the spunky mouse. The series was driven entirely by action and visual humour; the characters almost never spoke.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of Charecters in this cartoon.</p>
        <p>But my favourite Charecters are given below,,</p>

        <div class="charecter" id="tom">
            <h1 class="color-tomato">Tom</h1>
            <p>He is a grey sometimes bluish anthropomorphic domestic short-haired cat who first appeared in the 1940 animated short Puss Gets the Boot. Tom was originally known as Jasper during his debut in that short, however, beginning from his next appearance in The Midnight Snack and onwards his current name was used.</p>

            <h1 class="color-tomato">Jerry</h1>
            <p>
                Jerry is usually described as an excited, carefree and cheeky mouse, he in several episodes is shown to be cold as he seeks to have fun no matter who he harms, which to Tom's anger his sense of fun is sadistic, but he also has other targets although Tom is the main one among them.

        <div class="charecter" id="spike">
            <h1 class="color-tomato">Spike</h1>
            <p>
                Spike Bulldog is the tetartagonist of the Tom & Jerry franchise. He's a grey, rough bulldog that appears in many of Tom and Jerry cartoons. He has a somewhat minor friendship with Jerry and is a formidable enemy to Tom, who sees him as his agonist.

            <p>
                Are Tom and Jerry best friends? The answer according to the post is yes, they are best friends. The explanation the post offers is that Tom actually is fond of Jerry as a friend and vice versa. However, to protect Jerry, as he is a rodent, after all, Tom pretends to hate him and chase him in front of his owner.

            <p>Image result for the relation between tom and spike
                Spike's relationships with Tom and Jerry have varied from time to time, but essentially Spike has little affection for Tom Cat, who seems always to be disrupting his life, causing trouble, antagonizing Tyke or all of the above.</p>
