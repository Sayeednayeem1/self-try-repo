            <h1>My Favourite Cartoon Of All Time!</h1>
            <h1>Tom And Jerry.</h1>
            <p>Tom and Jerry is an American cartoon series about a hapless cat's never-ending pursuit of a clever mouse.</p>
            <p>Tom is the scheming cat, and Jerry is the spunky mouse. The series was driven entirely by action and visual humour; the characters almost never spoke.</p>

            Tom and Jerry is an American cartoon series about a hapless cat's never-ending pursuit of a clever mouse.

            Tom is the scheming cat, and Jerry is the spunky mouse. The series was driven entirely by action and visual humour; the characters almost never spoke.

        <h1 class="color-tomato">Charecters!</h1>
        <p>There are a lot of Charecters in this cartoon.</p>
        <p>But my favourite Charecters are given below,,</p>
    </div>
    <section class="flexible-container">
        <div class="charecter" id="tom">
            <h1 class="color-tomato">Tom</h1>
            <p>He is a grey sometimes bluish anthropomorphic domestic short-haired cat who first appeared in the 1940 animated short Puss Gets the Boot. Tom was originally known as Jasper during his debut in that short, however, beginning from his next appearance in The Midnight Snack and onwards his current name was used.</p>

        <div class="charecter" id="jerry">
            <h1 class="color-tomato">Jerry</h1>
            <p>
                Jerry is usually described as an excited, carefree and cheeky mouse, he in several episodes is shown to be cold as he seeks to have fun no matter who he harms, which to Tom's anger his sense of fun is sadistic, but he also has other targets although Tom is the main one among them.

        <div class="charecter" id="spike">
            <h1 class="color-tomato">Spike</h1>
            <p>
                Spike Bulldog is the tetartagonist of the Tom & Jerry franchise. He's a grey, rough bulldog that appears in many of Tom and Jerry cartoons. He has a somewhat minor friendship with Jerry and is a formidable enemy to Tom, who sees him as his agonist.
